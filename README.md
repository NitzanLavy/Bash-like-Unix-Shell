# Bash-like Unix Shell

- A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter, or shell, that provides a command-line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. There are few well-known shells on Unix systems. One of the most used is Bash. Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window. Users can interact with the Bash shell by typing commands that cause some actions.
- This project is an implementation of a Bash-like Unix Shell called “smash” (small shell) which will behave like a real Linux shell but will support only a limited subset of Linux shell commands.
- For further details please take a look at the Description.pdf file.
- Detailed code documentation is available at the Documentation.pdf file.
- This program was written in c++ language as part of a homework exercise in the course "Operating Systems" of the Technion.
